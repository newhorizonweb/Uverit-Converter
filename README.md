# Uverit Converter

[Uverit Converter](https://newhorizonweb.github.io/Uverit-Converter/) - Bridging Measurements Across Eras and Borders.

Effortlessly streamline your workflow when dealing with unit conversions.
No matter what, no matter where - you are only a few clicks away from accurate results!

## Converters

It's no secret that people use A LOT of units of measurement - ranging from obsolete, archaic systems to the modern "metric vs imperial" conflict.

Switching units on the fly can be challenging.
You may be familiar with a small, pretty cool company called NASA - full of the brightest minds on the planet. They lost $125 million because they did not use Uverit Converter!
Poor Mars Climate Orbiter...

## Features

It wouldn't be fun without some cool stuff sprinkled on top of the app, wouldn't it?
You can choose the rounding precision, copy the result, and switch the units around when needed. For some of the more complex conversions, you can toggle the exponential notation.
There is also an operation field so it's easier to understand the conversion process.

If that is not enough, you can still quickly look up and compare the units in the table below.

## Table

While converting units is great, sometimes it's more useful to compare them to each other.
You can print comprehensive tables with all the units or export them as PDFs for future reference.

## Accessibility

This application aims to make it easier to navigate through the vastness of systems developed by humans. That is why accessibility is so important - everyone deserves to have the ability to know a bit more about how things work.

With support for multiple languages and screen readers, this tool is designed to be accessible to everyone - because the only thing that should limit learning is curiosity!
